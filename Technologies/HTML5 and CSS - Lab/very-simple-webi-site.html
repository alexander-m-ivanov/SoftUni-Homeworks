        <p>HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting
            content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current
            version of the HTML standard.
        </p>
        <p>It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia
            , while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently
            understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers,
            etc, HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1
            and DOM Level 2 HTML.
        </p>
        <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more
            interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and
            rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces
            markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex
            web application.[5] For the same reason, HTML5 is also a candidate
            for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
            features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones
            and tablets.
