    <div class="left">float:left</div>
    <p>The float CSS property specifies
        that an element should be taken
        from the normal flow and placed
        along the left or right side of its container,
        where text and inline elements will wrap around it.
    </p>

    <div class="right">float:right</div>
    <p>The float CSS property specifies
        that an element should be taken
        from the normal flow and placed
        along the left or wight side of its container, where text and
        inline elements will wrap around.
    </p>

    <p>Without floating, the inline-block elements float like
        words in a text and block elements just do not float and
        stay in a vertical block of full width.
    </p>

    <p>Without floating, the inline-block elements float like
